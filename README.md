# RoboND-Localization-Project

Hi there! Thanks for taking a look at my project! This is the Localization project from the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program. Feel free to poke around or to download the code and give the launch files a run. The idea of the project was to build a robot model, give it sensors and actuators, and have it move and localize itself using ROS packages in a simulated Gazebo environment.

For a detailed writeup on the theory and actual development of the project, please refer to the Writeup: ``Where_Am_I.pdf``.
